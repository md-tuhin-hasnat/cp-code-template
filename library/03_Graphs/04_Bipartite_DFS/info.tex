A bipartite graph checking using DFS with 2-coloring. This is an alternative to the BFS approach.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$

\textbf{Advantages of DFS over BFS:}
\begin{itemize}
\item More concise recursive implementation
\item Better for finding connected components
\item Uses implicit stack (recursion)
\end{itemize}
