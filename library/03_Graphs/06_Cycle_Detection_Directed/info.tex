Detects cycles in a directed graph using DFS with path tracking (recursion stack).

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$

\textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use two arrays: \texttt{vis[]} (visited) and \texttt{pathvis[]} (in current path)
\item Mark node as visited and in current path during DFS
\item If we visit a node that's in the current path, we found a cycle
\item Unmark from path when backtracking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Difference from Undirected:}
\begin{itemize}
\item In directed graphs, we check if node is in current recursion path
\item In undirected graphs, we check parent to avoid false positives
\end{itemize}
