Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure with union by rank and path compression. Efficiently manages dynamic connectivity queries.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} Nearly $O(1)$ amortized per operation (inverse Ackermann function)

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$

\textbf{Operations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{init(V)}: Initialize V nodes
\item \texttt{findRoot(node)}: Find root with path compression
\item \texttt{unionByRank(u, v)}: Union two sets by rank
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Optimizations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Path compression: Makes all nodes on path point directly to root
\item Union by rank: Attach smaller tree under larger tree
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kruskal's MST algorithm
\item Checking connectivity
\item Finding connected components
\end{itemize}
