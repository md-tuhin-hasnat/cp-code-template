Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting using BFS and indegree tracking.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with vertices having indegree 0
\item Remove vertices and decrease indegree of neighbors
\item If result size $\neq$ V, graph has cycle
\end{itemize}
