Kruskal's algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Disjoint Set Union with union by rank.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(E \log E)$ for sorting edges

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sort all edges by weight
\item Iterate through sorted edges
\item If edge connects two different components, add it to MST
\item Use DSU to check connectivity and merge components
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Properties:}
\begin{itemize}
\item MST has exactly $V-1$ edges
\item Works on weighted undirected graphs
\item Greedy algorithm (always picks minimum weight edge)
\end{itemize}
