Disjoint Set Union (DSU) with union by size. Similar to union by rank but maintains actual sizes of trees.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} Nearly $O(1)$ amortized per operation

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$

\textbf{Differences from Union by Rank:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintains actual size of subtrees instead of rank
\item Always attach smaller tree to larger tree
\item Can query size of components directly
\end{itemize}
