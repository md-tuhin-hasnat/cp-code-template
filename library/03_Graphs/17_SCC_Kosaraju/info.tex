Kosaraju's algorithm finds Strongly Connected Components in a directed graph.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
\item DFS on original graph to get finish times
\item DFS on reverse graph in decreasing finish time order
\item Each DFS tree in second pass is an SCC
\end{itemize}
