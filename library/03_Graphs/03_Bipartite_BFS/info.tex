A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects vertices from different sets. This implementation uses BFS with 2-coloring.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$

\textbf{Key Concept:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Color vertices with alternating colors (0 and 1)
\item If two adjacent vertices have the same color, graph is not bipartite
\item A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd-length cycles
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Matching problems
\item Scheduling problems
\item Network flow problems
\end{itemize}
