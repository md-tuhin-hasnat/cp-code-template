Detects cycles in an undirected graph using DFS with parent tracking.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V)$

\textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Track parent node during DFS to avoid false cycle detection
\item If we visit a node that's already visited and not the parent, we found a cycle
\item Different from directed graphs: we must ignore the parent edge
\end{itemize}
