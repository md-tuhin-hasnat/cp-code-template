Prim's algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using a priority queue.

\textbf{Time Complexity:} $O(E \log V)$

\textbf{Space Complexity:} $O(V + E)$

\textbf{Algorithm:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Start from any vertex
\item Greedily add the minimum weight edge connecting the MST to a new vertex
\item Use priority queue to efficiently select minimum edge
\item Mark vertices as visited when added to MST
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Differences from Kruskal:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kruskal: sorts edges, grows forest of trees
\item Prim: grows single tree from starting vertex
\item Prim: better for dense graphs
\item Kruskal: better for sparse graphs
\end{itemize}
